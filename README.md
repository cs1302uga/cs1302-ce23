An employee’s net income is defined as their gross income     
minus their deductions. For example, an employee with a       
gross income of 100 and two deductions {0.1, 0.25} has a   
net income of 100 − 100(0.1 + 0.25) = 65. Write a code snippet                                                                        
that, given a java.util.List of Employee objects called array,                                                                        
prints the sum of the net incomes for all high earning level 2                                                           
employees using the Java Stream API. A high earning employee  
is one with a net income exceeding 100,000. You may           
write extra methods, if needed. You may not use loops.
